<h1> Overwatch 2 Big tips</h1>
<p> In this article, I will share with you 5 big tips that in my opinion, will help you have the best experience playing Overwatch. </p>
<br>
<h2> Tip 1: Try to utilize the training range, AI game modes and custom games(either your own custom games or other players)</h2>
    <p> Practicing in the training range can be very helpful in helping aim better, determine ultimate charge rates per hero, and more.</p>
    <p> The practice range is your friend, and pretty much everyone uses it, pros and lower leveled players alike</p>
    <p> It's also a good idea to practice against different levels of AI players, as it can help you track the enemies more and can also help you be more strategical when fighting duels and such. </p>
    <p> It's also a good idea to perhaps try to find custom games that are designed specifically on how to become better at the game, whether that is aiming, or being able to be better at ultimate and ability managment.</p>
<h2> Tip 2: Try to get familiar with a lot of the common maps, (such as Hybrid, Escort, Control, Flashpoint and Push maps)</h2>
    <p> What I mean by this, is try to get a good solid grasp of what are the key locations on the map that you or the enemy could utilize</p>
    <p> This means like, knowing where the health packs, but also knowing where the high ground points are, where certain heroes could utilze to their advantage whether on your team or on the enemy's</p>
    <p> The best way to do that is to well play more games, as you'll become more familiar with the maps, but you can also create your custom games of these maps, with only yourself and explore the map outside of a match.</p>
<h2> Tip 3: Try to utilize the communication tools in OW2 matches</h2>
    <p> There are loads of ways to communicate with the team.</p>
    <p> You can utilize the voice chat and text chat built into the game to communicate with people.</p>
    <p> However if you are not comfortable with this, OW2 has a built in Communication Wheel, where you can utilize already built in voice lines to help communicate important info</p>
    <p> Some of the voicelines in this voice wheel are "I need Healing, which is used to communicate to the supports that you are low health, "Thanks!" Which can be used to thank your teammates, and "My Ultimate status."</p>
    <p> Additionally, there's also a "Ping wheel" that can also be used to communicate. This can be used to identify where the enemy is, or telling them to fall back and more.</p>
    <p> Communication can really help propel teams to better chances of victory</p>
    <h2> Tip 4: Try to learn at least 2 to 3 heroes in the role that you are maining </h2>
    <p> In OW2, there is a term called "Onetricking" where you basically only play one hero and don't play any other hero.</p>
    <p> This practice is not recommended, as there can be cases where your hero is not viable or someone else is playing your hero.</p>
    <p> So because of this, I do not recommend onetricking and instead, try to learn at least 2 or 3 heroes outside of your main in your role</p>
    <h2> Tip 5: Always move around and never stay in one place for too long</h2>
    <p> In OW, it is a never a good idea to stay in one place for too long </p>
    <p> This is because doing so, can make it easier for the enemy to find you and kill you often.</p>
    <p> So always keep moving in OW2 Matches and try to be unpredictable in your movements as well</p>
